[ETL & Data Quality](https://github.com/ankur715/fetch_coding_challenge/tree/main/first_etl_data_quality) The source data of Users, Products, and Trasactions csv files was read and cleaned. The data quality was analyzed because it directly impacts the reliability, accuracy, and usefulness of any insights or decisions derived from the data. The goal is to optimize data processsing and efficiency by identifying and fixing data quality issues. It is also essential to mitigate risk with the users. Then, the tables were created and loaded using the cleaned csv data files. The data schema that was provided was used to link the tables.
